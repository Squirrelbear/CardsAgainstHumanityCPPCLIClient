# Cards Against Humanity C++ CLI Client

A client designed to communicate on the CLI with a NodeJS server via queries.This project is currently a work in progress and may continue to see updates dependent on time available to work on the project. This project pairs with a NodeJS server. See the NodeJS server for related code: ([Github Link](https://github.com/Squirrelbear/CardsAgainstHumanity-NodeJSServer)).

The server processes commands via query data eg:</br>
